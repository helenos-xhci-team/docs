\chapter{Writing USB Drivers}

This chapter provides documentation and general guidelines for usage of the
refactored USB device driver interface. As such, it is meant for developers of
HelenOS device drivers, who can use it as a reference guide. By intention, this
section abstracts the reader from all modifications to the stack, and focuses
only on the latest state of the interface. All changes to the interface are
described in detail in Chapter \ref{usb-refactoring}.

The reader should note that there exists a similar section in the initial USB
stack documentation. The text in this chapter could be considered an updated
version or extension of that text.


\section{Basics}
This section gives details on the basic structure of USB device drivers, their
role in the system and components they usually interact with.


\subsection{Framework}
USB device drivers use the generic \textit{Device Driver Framework} available in
HelenOS. Because all USB drivers have similar initialization routines, a thin
layer -- specific to USB devices -- was added above the generic one. This layer
mainly serves as a middleware for easy communication with USB host controller
drivers, performing USB specific resource management and enabling device drivers
to initialize endpoint pipes and interact with USB devices. For those reasons,
USB device drivers are recommended to link with \lib{libdrv} and
\lib{libusbdev}, which contain both aforementioned layers respectively.

It is expected that USB device drivers specify in advance not only their
relevant match identifiers, which are used by the Device Manager to pair new
devices with available drivers, but also all endpoints, which shall be present
on the device through a USB driver structure. Later when a new device is found,
a specialized device structure is prepared and pipe abstractions are
initialized.

Device drivers live the same life cycle as any other drivers controlled by the
\textit{Device Manager}. A quick summary follows:
~
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The driver is started at the convenience of the Device Manager if and
	when a compatible device is found. At startup, the driver registers with the
	USB framework, which in turn registers also with the Device Driver
	Framework.

	\item During its lifetime, the driver receives IPC callbacks from the USB
	Framework, informing it about relevant device events. On the basis of these
	events, the driver then communicates with the device and exposes various
	interfaces to other tasks in the system. At this point, the controlled
	device usually becomes visible and useful to the user.

	\item When there is no more need for the driver to run (i.e. no devices to
	control), the Device Manager terminates the driver to save resources.
\end{enumerate}
