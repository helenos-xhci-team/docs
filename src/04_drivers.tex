\chapter{Writing USB Drivers}

This section provides documentation and general guidelines for usage of the
refactored USB device driver interface. As such, it is meant for developers of
HelenOS device drivers, who can use it as a reference guide.

By intention, this section abstracts the reader from all modifications to the
stack, and focuses only on the latest state of the interface. All changes to the
interface are described in detail in Chapter \ref{usb-refactoring}.
