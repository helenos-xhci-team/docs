\chapter{xHCI Stack Implementation}

The structure of the xHCI driver is quite straightforward, as it tries to fit
into the scheme of how hardware and the rest of HelenOS works. We decided to
use the existing library \lib{libusbhost} to reduce code duplication with
other HC drivers. It came out that this library need a lot of changes to
support us in this goal, but that's for chapter \ref{usb-refactoring}.

The USB host controller driver using \lib{libusbhost}, xHCI included, serves as
a connecting layer between the hardware and library, and exposes its bus
interface.

\end{figure}

The scheme is not at all strict, we're in a C world, there are dependencies
almost everywhere -- take it as an informal overview to get an idea.

The whole driver can be split into two parts. The left one takes care about the
hardware perception on what's going on, the right one is about managing the
software structures and memory.

We start with describing the modules in the hardware part, as their
functionality is clear. Their order follows the order in which they were
implemented.

\subsection{Implementation}

\section{Scratchpad}

Scratchpads are buffers that an xHC implementation can request from the system software
for its internal needs. The size of these buffers is specified in the \textit{PAGESIZE} register
found in the operational register set defined in \struct{xhci_op_regs}.

The amount of buffers requested by the xHC is specified in the \textit{Max Scratchpad Bufs Hi} and
\textit{Max Scratchpad Bufs Lo} registers of the second set of structural parameters (\textit{HCSPARAMS2},
see section 5.3.4 of the xHCI specification) defined in \struct{xhci_cap_regs}.

The allocation of these buffers takes place as part of the host constroller initialization,
specifically in \fnc{hc_init_memory()}, which calls \fnc{xhci_scratchpad_alloc()}. The pointers
to these buffers are then passed to the xHC in the \textit{Scratchpad Buffer Array}, pointer to which
occupies the first index of the \textit{Device Context Base Address Array} (dcbaa field of
\struct{xhci_hc_t}).

Our implementation originally implemented these as a standalone structure \struct{xhci_scratchpad_t},
which served mainly for the purposes of resource management by keeping both the physical addresses
for the xHC and the virtual addresses for deallocation. This was, however, later refactored to use
\struct{dma_buffer_t}, which is part of \lib{libusbhost} was created for the same purpose.

Once the xHCI driver finishes its execution, the scratchpad buffers are deallocated by a call to
\fnc{xhci_scratchpad_free()} as part of \fnc{hc_fini()}.

\section{Roothub}

The purpose of this module is very simple -- take care of the root hub. Before
we explain how our roothub works, let's have a look on why and how other HC
drivers' handle it.

The main problem a hub driver faces is a synchronization one. When a new device
is detected, it needs to be enumerated. Enumeration process in case of USB 2.0
devices requires the hub to reset the port the device is attached to, to move
it the \textit{Default} state, when it's listening on the default address 0.
Wen the port reset is triggered, the hub must wait until the port reset is
complete. During the whole process, the device can be disconnected, and the
port reset will never be completed. Furthermore, the completion of port reset
is indicated by the same means as port connection, resulting in a deadlock in
the na\"ive solution. The proper solution therefore involves spawning new
fibrils and nontrivial synchronization.

All four HC drivers (UHCI, OHCI, EHCI and VHC) are using a virtual roothub. In
principle that means that they create a virtual USB device, which is listening
at the default address in the beginning, and trigger an enumeration process.
Then there is a little branch in transfer scheduling, that takes transfers
directed to the same address as the virtual device's, and delivers them by
calling a function instead. The virtual device behaves exactly like a real USB
hub would -- it has its standard descriptors, reply to setup requests and so
on. So it enumerates like a USB hub would, and creates a DDF device, which is
taken by the \texttt{usbhub} driver. The driver then handles the virtual
roothub like any other hub, by sending USB control transfers. The virthub
module translates USB transfers to callbacks, which are implemented by
individual HC driver to read and modify register space of the Host Controller.

This solution is very clean in design, regarding that root hub functionality is
exactly the same as any other hub's, it is just controlled by MMIO mapped
registers instead of USB packets. It is even recommended by the USB 2.0			% TODO: Link to USB2 spec
specification to embody this solution. But that's pretty much the only advance
this solution has. One has to write a lot of code to even implement the
callbacks, not mentioning the virthub module itself. And a lot of code always
come with bugs. Also, while having no real performance impact, it requires
several context switches, IPC calls, bouncing memory buffers and a lot of
unnecessary allocations to clear one bit in the register space (USB hubs
operate by setting and clearing so called Features, indicating e.g. that
a connection on port changed). But it needs to be stressed more, that this
performance impact is mitigated by the fact real hub use real USB transactions
above that, and that hub interaction is very sparse.

We searched for solution, that would keep the cleanness in terms of shared
functionality between usbhub driver and roothub, and decided to move the port
state machine and related fibril synchronization into the USB library. That
cleanly separates the hardest part of handling hub port changes from the code
that is actually handling them and enumerating the devices. This state machine
is used by both xHCI roothub, and also by the rewritten usbhub. More
information about this new module can be found in section \ref{hub-port-refactoring}.

One more thing related to the xHCI roothub, which we crossed while debugging on
real hardware. The USB hub have a bit dedicated to indicate that a port is
enabled (PED), and the port can be disabled using it. Counterintuitively, the
port is disabled by writing a 1 to it. Even worse, this bit is in the same
field as the change bits with RW1C semantics are -- which means that the
standard approach of reading and writing back the value read fails hard. This
took us several hours to discover, because the port reset was completed
successfully, but right after that, the device was inaccessible, even when we
didn't do anything with it yet. To make matters more complicated, QEMU ignores
this bit completely, so the code worked fine in a virtual environment.
