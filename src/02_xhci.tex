\chapter{xHCI Stack Implementation}

The structure of the xHCI driver is quite straightforward, as it tries to fit
into the scheme of how hardware and the rest of HelenOS works. We decided to
use the existing library \lib{libusbhost} to reduce code duplication with
other HC drivers. It came out that this library needs a lot of changes to
support us in this goal, but that's for chapter \ref{usb-refactoring}.

The USB host controller driver using \lib{libusbhost}, xHCI included, serves as
a connecting layer between the hardware and library, and exposes its bus
interface.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{The modules of xHCI driver}
\end{figure}

The scheme is not at all strict, we're in a C world, there are dependencies
almost everywhere -- take it as an informal overview to get an idea.

The whole driver can be split into two parts. The left one takes care of the
hardware perception of what's going on, the right one is about managing the
software structures and memory.

We start with describing the modules in the hardware part, as their
functionality is clear. Their order follows the order in which they were
implemented.

\section{Hardware Structures}

The \file{uspace/drv/bus/usb/xhci/hw\_struct}{hw\_struct} directory contains C structures
that represent registers and control structures used by the xHC. The memory layout of the
structures is defined by the xHCI specification and thus the files in this directory should
be mostly treated as read-only.

\subsection{Registers}

The register structures (defined in \file{uspace/drv/bus/usb/xhci/hw\_struct/regs.h}{regs.h})
represent hardware registers presented by the xHC to system software
implemented as Memory-Mapped I/O space. They can be divided into four categories as follows:
~
\begin{description}
	\item[Capability registers]
		These specify read-only limits, restrictions, and capabilities of the specific
		xHC implementation used.
	\item[Runtime and Operational registers]
		These specify the current xHC configuration and runtime modifiable state.
	\item[Extended capabilities]
		These specify optional features of the current xHC implementation.
	\item[Doorbell array]
		An array of up to 256 doorbell registers, which supports up to 255 USB devices
		or hubs. Each doorbell register provides the software with a mechanism for
		notifying the xHC if it has slot or endpoint related work to perform.
\end{description}

In our implementation, all of these can be accessed through the \struct{xhci_hc_t} structure and
can be modified through it using the register handling macros defined in
\file{uspace/drv/bus/usb/xhci/hw\_struct/regs.h}{regs.h}. Note that not all register bits can be
manipulated freely by the system, some impose restrictions:
~
\begin{description}
	\item[RO, Read-only]
		Register bits are read-only and cannot be altered by system software. An example
		is the \textit{CAPLENGTH} register (see \xhci{5.3.1}).
	\item[RW, Read-Write]
		Register bits are read-write and can be altered by system software. An example
		is the \textit{USBCMD} register (see \xhci{5.4.1}), in which some bits or bit ranges
		are RW (and some are read-only).
	\item[RW1C, Write-1-to-clear]
		Register bits indicate status when read, a set bit can be cleared by writing
		a '1', writing a '0' to such register bit has no effect. An example is
		the \textit{Event Interrupt} bit in the \textit{USBSTS} register (see \xhci{5.4.2}) which is set
		to '1' by the xHC when an interrupt occurs and can be cleared by the driver
		by writing '1' to it once the event is scheduled for handling.
	\item[RW1S, Write-1-to-set]
		Register bits indicate status when read, a clear bit can be set by writing
		a '1', writing a '0' to such register bit has no effect. Examples are the
		\textit{Command Stop} and \textit{Command Abort} bits of the \textit{CRCR} register
		(see \xhci{5.4.5}).
\end{description}

This is not an exhaustive list of access attributes, for the entire list, see \xhci{5.1.1}.

\subsubsection{Register access macros}

Registers are accessed very often in all hardware-related modules. We felt that
there is a need to centralize the information defined in the specification,
especially the subdivision of registers to individual fields. There are several
common solutions to this problem.

Probably the most common one, which we also considered at first, is defining
two constants for every such field: mask and shift. When one needs to read
a field, they read the value of the register, use the mask to select bits, and
then shift the value according to the shift macro. To write a field, one reads
the value of the whole register, uses the bitwise negation of the mask to copy
surrounding bits, then shift the value to be written into its place. This
solution is simple to understand, yet hard to use correctly. There's a lot of
repetition, the more if you consider endianity (HelenOS is targeted also on Big
Endian platforms, while the USB world is Little Endian).

Another possibility is to define macros for reading and writing every single
field. That idea was discarded in its very beginning. We wanted a solution,
that requires only one definition per field, cannot be used in a wrong way and
is sensibly short to write. So we came up with the register access macros. The
best introduction is probably by an artificial example:

\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{code}
#define XHCI_SOME_FIELD            usbreg, 32, RANGE, 13, 7

unsigned field = XHCI_REG_RD(hc->op_regs, XHCI_SOME_FIELD);
XHCI_REG_WR(hc->op_regs, XHCI_SOME_FIELD, 42);
\end{code}
	\caption[An example of using register macros]{On the first line, we read
	bits 13 to 7 of the field \mintinline{c}{hc->op_regs->usbreg} to
	a variable, and then change the same bits in the register to a value 42.}
\end{listing}

All the definitions of macros like \macro{XHCI_SOME_FIELD} relevant for xHCI
are contained in the header file \header|hw_struct/regs.h|. The definition
contains all the information necessary to access the field. It says that the
register field is contained in a field \struct{usbreg} of an operational
register structure (the one \mintinline{c}{hc->op_regs} points to), the
structure field is a 32-bit wide dword, and that the register field is
contained in bits 13 to 7 of it.

The primary principle used to implement these preprocessor macros is the
specific order of macro expansion in C. In the example, the register definition
macro is used as an argument to the \macro{XHCI_REG_RD} macro. Both macros are
expanded in a breadth-first fashion, producing just another preprocessor macro
\macro{XHCI_REG_RD_INNER(hc->op_regs, usbreg, 32, RANGE, 13, 7)}. You can see
that one argument is expanded to several arguments for the inner macro. What
happens next is pretty simple. The \macro{RANGE} argument token is glued to
a prefix, producing a name for another macro, which selects between
implementations for whole fields, bit ranges and individual bit flags. The
\macro{XHCI_REG_RD_RANGE} then extracts the specified bits read from the whole
field. The size argument is needed to properly handle endianity. All other
top-level macros (\macro{XHCI_REG_WR}, \macro{XHCI_REG_SET},
\macro{XHCI_REG_CLR}, \macro{XHCI_REG_MASK} and \macro{XHCI_REG_SHIFT}) operate
on the same principle.

We think we have achieved our goal. These macros are a bit hard to understand but
very easy to use and require just one line of definition per field. Looking
back though, the work was probably not worth it -- the registers are not used
that much to justify the existence of register definition of every single register
field. But it is already done and shall there be a need to access more registers,
it's easily accessible without thinking how to select the proper bits and
ensure the correct endianness. And even if there wasn't, it serves as a nice
showcase of what are preprocessor macros capable of.

\subsection{Contexts}

Contexts (defined in \file{uspace/drv/bus/usb/xhci/hw\_struct/context.h}{context.h})
are control structures that represent devices and their configuration as well
as the parameters of the communication between the xHC and system software. The
\struct{xhci_hc_t} structure contains the \textit{Device Context Base Address Array} (DCBAA), which
holds up to 255 pointers to device contexts at indices 1 through 255 and a pointer to
the scratchpad array (see \ref{sec:scratchpads}). Each device context contains a slot
context (used to describe the device as a whole, represented by \struct{xhci_slot_ctx_t}) and
31 context for each endpoint (represented by \struct{xhci_ep_ctx_t}). Most of these contexts
will be described in more detail in the following sections.

% TODO device & input ctx problem with 32-bit and 64-bit?

\section{Debug}

Since both the internal state of the xHC and its capabilities are often described by
a handful of bits located in a packed 32-bit register, we needed a way to monitor these
values in a human-readable form. The \file{uspace/drv/bus/usb/xhci/debug.h}{debug.h} and
\file{uspace/drv/bus/usb/xhci/debug.c}{debug.c} files contain a set of register dumping
functions that use the register reading macros described in the previous section to print
the values of all the bit sets contained in a register to the driver's log. They also contain
auxiliary functions that are used to convert numeric codes to their meaning in a string form and
functions that dump the contents of a hardware structure (such as \struct{xhci_endpoint_ctx}).

These functions have proved to be of great use and should any future maintainer of the
HelenOS xHC stack find themselves in a bug-ridden situation, putting these functions to
the areas of code they suspect of mischievous deeds might be a good starting point.

\input{02_trb_ring}

\section{Scratchpad}
\label{sec:scratchpads}

Scratchpads are buffers that a xHC implementation can request from the system software
for its internal needs. The size of these buffers is specified in the \textit{PAGESIZE} register
found in the operational register set defined in \struct{xhci_op_regs}.

The amount of buffers requested by the xHC is specified in the \textit{Max Scratchpad Bufs Hi} and
\textit{Max Scratchpad Bufs Lo} registers of the second set of structural parameters (\textit{HCSPARAMS2},
see \xhci{5.3.4}) defined in \struct{xhci_cap_regs}.

The allocation of these buffers takes place as part of the host controller initialization,
specifically in \fnc{hc_init_memory}, which calls \fnc{xhci_scratchpad_alloc}. The pointers
to these buffers are then passed to the xHC in the \textit{Scratchpad Buffer Array}, pointer to which
occupies the first index of the \textit{Device Context Base Address Array} (dcbaa field of
\struct{xhci_hc_t}).

Our implementation originally implemented these as a standalone structure \struct{xhci_scratchpad_t},
which served mainly for the purposes of resource management by keeping both the physical addresses
for the xHC and the virtual addresses for deallocation. This was, however, later refactored to use
\struct{dma_buffer_t}, which is part of \lib{libusbhost} and was created for the same purpose.

Once the xHCI driver finishes its execution, the scratchpad buffers are deallocated by a call to
\fnc{xhci_scratchpad_free} as part of \fnc{hc_fini}.


\input{02_commands}

\section{Host Controller Module}

This module contains the mixture of things that didn't fit anywhere else or
didn't deserve their own submodule. We tried to move the ``xHCI specification
quirks'' here, so that other modules rely only on the semantics and overview of
the xHCI, and don't care that much about the exact technical details. Of
course, it's not strictly possible, because the whole driver is about technical
details of xHCI.

\subsection{Initialization}

A substantial part of this module handles the initialization of the controller.
When the xHC device is added, several steps need to be done. Let's walk through
them in order. The DDF callback \fnc{dev_add} is handled by the
\lib{libusbhost} library, so the story begins there.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
	At the very beginning, the supplementary structures are allocated in the
	DDF device node. These structures accompany the entire lifetime of a driven
	HC.

\item
	The DDF control function is created. Through it, the user may command the
	HC driver.

\item
	The hardware resources such as MMIO space or IRQ number are obtained from
	the parent device (usually PCI driver).

	Now, the structure and hardware resources are handed out to the xHCI driver for
	the first time, to do its initialization.

\item
	The MMIO range needs to be mapped, and the proper register areas found.
	xHCI specifies several areas of MMIO registers, with variable offsets
	between them. We cache the pointers to the areas inside the
	\struct{xhci_hc_t} structure to make the access convenient.

\item
	The roothub structures are initialized. The number of ports is obtained and
	memory for state machines is allocated.

\item
	Extended capabilities need to be parsed soon enough, as they contain some
	crucial information. Namely the information about legacy support, but also
	the protocol versions supported on individual roothub ports.

\item
	A lot of memory structures are to be initialized now. The \emph{DCBA}
	array, event ring, scratchpads, command ring, the device-keeping array and
	also the event worker fibril.

	After all of that, the basic driver initialization is completed, and the
	execution returns to the library.

\item
	The interrupts need to be enabled if they are available. The driver is
	given an opportunity to generate the bottom-half IRQ handling code, and
	then the code is registered in the kernel. Shall any of these steps fail,
	the failure is not critical and the interrupts are just marked unavailable.

\item
	If the HC is being controlled by the BIOS (denoted by the extended
	capability), it needs to be claimed.

\item
	The HC is started. In case of xHCI, an initialization sequence as described
	in the specification is performed. The HC is reset to transition into
	a known state. The addresses of the memory structures are configured. If
	the interrupts are available, the interrupter 0 is enabled. Finally, the HC
	is started by setting a bit in the operational registers.

\item
	Before the control is returned to the library, all roothub ports are
	checked for a change, because the reset changed their connection state,
	but the Port Change Events had no ring to be written on.

\item
	If the interrupts are not available, a replacement polling fibril is
	started.

\item
	The roothub is to be set up. Other HCs using virthub must undergo an
	enumeration process, so this must be done after the initialization is fully
	completed. In the case of xHCI, this step is skipped.
\end{enumerate}

A symmetric reverse sequence is performed to make the HC stopped again. This
functionality is however not tested because PCI devices are not hotpluggable,
not even in QEMU.

\subsection{Events}
\label{sec:events}

Another functionality provided by the HC module is the first line of handling
events. Events are the primary information channel from the device to the host.
Every synchronous operation needs to be finished by waiting for an event.

The tricky part in handling events is, again, the synchronization. Event
handlers must not issue operations, which would wait for other events. The
problem is that this event dependency is inevitable in some cases. Let us
describe two scenarios which will explain the complexity of the final solution.

First, there are the Port State Changed Events. Handling these events usually
involves device enumeration -- that is however handled in a separate fibril.
It's even not the reset completion which would create a deadlock -- if it is
expected, all the locks are unlocked. The main problem is a device
disconnection while the enumeration is still in progress -- when it happens,
the event handling fibril must wait until the enumeration fibril terminates.
But the enumeration might be in the later phase, in which it issues commands.
In order to terminate, a command must be completed. That introduces
a dependency, which cannot be simply removed. Because of it, Port Change
Detected Events and Command Completion Events must be handled independently on
each other.

Similarly, the enumeration process involves fetching descriptors from the
device. That introduces another dependency, this time between Transfer
Events and Port Change Detected Events. Neither of these two can be handled
sequentially.

The last dependency is between Command Completion Events and Transfer Events,
forming a dependency triangle. This one might not be that obvious, but it is
there and cannot be avoided easily. The handler of the Transfer Event needs to
obtain a reference to an endpoint. To ensure coherency, the reference must be
created while the endpoint is still registered, in a critical section. The same
critical section that protects the endpoint unregistration -- which needs to
abort currently running transfers.

In order to avoid a deadlock, all three types of events need to be processed
separately. We achieve that by processing only so-called fast events (Command
Completion, MFINDEX Wrap) in the interrupt handler, and route the Port Change
Events and Transfer Events to two Software TRB Rings (see section \ref{sec:sw-rings}),
from which two other worker fibrils dequeue and handle the events independently.

\subsection{Commands abstraction}

Although the command interface has a module on its own, there are situations
where the specific commands used are a technical detail hiding the actual
semantics of the operation. To give an example, to inform the HC about dropping
an endpoint, one must issue the \emph{Configure Endpoint} command with a flag
set. Also, some commands require an input context with a proper content, some don't.

The rest of the Host controller module tries to cover these implementation
details and offer a more intuitive interface. Although the device and endpoint
modules do fill the contexts on their own (being also a technical detail), the
decision whether it's needed to fill an input context is left to the HC module.

\section{Root Hub}

The purpose of this module is very simple -- take care of the root hub. Before
we explain how our roothub works, let's have a look at why and how other HC
drivers handle it.

The main problem a hub driver faces is a synchronization one. When a new device
is detected, it needs to be enumerated. Enumeration process in the case of USB 2.0
devices requires the hub to reset the port the device is attached to in order to move
it to the \state{Default} state when it's listening on the default address 0.
When the port reset is triggered, the hub must wait until the port reset is
complete. During the whole process the device can be disconnected and the
port reset will never be completed. Furthermore, the completion of the port reset
is indicated by the same means as port connection, resulting in a deadlock in
the na\"ive solution. The proper solution therefore involves spawning new
fibrils and nontrivial synchronization.

All four HC drivers (UHCI, OHCI, EHCI, and VHC) are using a virtual roothub. In
principle that means that they create a virtual USB device, which is listening
on the default address in the beginning, and trigger an enumeration process.
Then there is a little branch in transfer scheduling, that takes transfers
directed to the same address as the virtual device's, and delivers them by
calling a function instead. The virtual device behaves exactly like a real USB
hub would -- it has its standard descriptors, replies to setup requests and so
on. So it enumerates like a USB hub would and creates a DDF device, which is
taken by the \texttt{usbhub} driver. The driver then handles the virtual
roothub like any other hub -- by sending USB control transfers. The virthub
module translates USB transfers to callbacks, which are implemented by the
individual HC drivers to read and modify register space of the Host Controller.

This solution is very clean in design, regarding that root hub functionality is
exactly the same as any other hub's, but just controlled by MMIO mapped
registers instead of USB packets. It is even recommended by the USB 2.0			% TODO: Link to USB2 spec
specification to embody this solution. But that's pretty much the only advantage
this solution has. One has to write a lot of code to even implement the
callbacks, not mentioning the virthub module itself. And a lot of code always
comes with bugs. Also, while having no real performance impact, it requires
several context switches, IPC calls, bouncing memory buffers and a lot of
unnecessary allocations to clear one bit in the register space (USB hubs
operate by setting and clearing so-called Features, indicating e.g. that
a connection on port changed). But it needs to be stressed more that this
performance impact is mitigated by the fact that real hubs use real USB transactions
above that and that hub interaction is very sparse.

We searched for a solution that would keep the cleanness in terms of shared
functionality between usbhub driver and roothub and decided to move the port
state machine and related fibril synchronization into the USB library. That
cleanly separates the hardest part of handling hub port changes from the code
that is actually handling them and enumerating the devices. This state machine
is used by both the xHCI roothub and also by the rewritten usbhub. More
information about this new module can be found in section \ref{hub-port-refactoring}.

One more thing related to the xHCI roothub, which we crossed while debugging on
real hardware: the USB hub has a bit dedicated to indicate that a port is
enabled (PED), and the port can be disabled using it. Counterintuitively, the
port is disabled by writing a 1 to it. Even worse, this bit is in the same
field as the change bits with RW1C semantics are -- which means that the
standard approach of reading and writing back the value read fails hard. This
took us several hours to discover because the port reset was completed
successfully, but right after that, the device was inaccessible, even when we
didn't do anything with it yet. To make matters more complicated, QEMU ignores
this bit completely so the code worked fine in a virtual environment.

\section{Bus Module}

% TODO: After the device will be split, will there be anything interesting to write about?

\subsection{Device}

Devices in the xHCI are represented by structures called device contexts, these are
managed by the xHC and used to report device conguration and current state. A device
context consists of a slot context, which represents the device as a whole (e.g. contains
information about addressing or power management) and is implemented in the \struct{xhci_slot_ctx_t}
structure, and 31 endpoint contexts (which are described in the following section)
for each of the device's possible endpoints (though most of them may never be used).

Note that one will not find a specific structure used to represent a device context. We had
one at first, but later discovered that according to a note in section 6.2.1 of the
specification, the \textit{Context Size} field in the \textit{HCCPARAMS1} register determines whether
a device context contains 32 or 64 byte members (the size of the individual members does
not change, but the 64 byte version adds 32 byte wide padding to each of them). Because
of this, the device context structure cannot be represented statically and instead had to be
implemented as a DMA buffer (see section \ref{sec:dma_bufs}) and its members have to
be accessed dynamically at runtime.

A device is initialized during a process called device enumeration, which begins when
the system detects a new device and calls \fnc{xhci_device_enumerate} defined in
\file{uspace/drv/bus/usb/xhci/device.c}{device.c}. This function then initializes the device
by requesting its slot (index to the \textit{Device Context Base Address Array} field in
\struct{xhci_hc_t}), enabling and configuring its control endpoint and requesting
an address for it.
